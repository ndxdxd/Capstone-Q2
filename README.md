# Capstone Quarter 2 Project: Adversarial Attacks on Invisible Watermark

By Anushka Purohit and Andy Truong

This project innovates a new watermarking scheme, creating an invisible watermark inspired through adversarial attacks. Specifically, Projected Gradient Descent where we add small pertubations onto an image to misclassify it.

This project explores the question: Can we create a watermark that is robust to regeneration and destructive attacks without greatly sacrificing the quality of an image.

## Running the project

First git clone the repository on your local machine, and make sure that you have a gpu that can run the notebook. 
To install the dependencies, run the following command from the root directory of the project: pip install -r requirements.txt

Use the demo.ipynb file in the notebook folder to look at the watermark creating and verification functions and run it.
